# Intro

## Internet
- Hardware
  - Billions of devices: **hosts** or **end systems**
  - Devices are connected with **communication links** (e.g. fiber, with a transmission rate called **bandwidth** in bits per second)
  - **Packet switches** forward packets (chunks of data) with **routers** and **switches**
- Software
  - **protocols**: controls sending and receiving of messages (TCP, IP, HTTP, etc)
  - **standards**:
    - RFC (request for comments)
    - IETF (internet engineering task force)
- Infrastructure
  - Provides services to applications (web, VoIP, email, etc)
  - Provides programming interface to apps

Network edge:
- hosts: clients and servers
- servers are often in data centers

Access networks, physical media: wired, wireless communication links

Network core
- Interconnected routers
- network of networks

**Frequency division multiplexing**: different channels transmitted in different frequencies

**HFC**: hybrid fiber coax
- 30Mbps down, 2Mbps up
- Shared line for neighbourhood, not a direct connection like in DSL
